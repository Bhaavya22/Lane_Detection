# Lane Detection

This repository contains a Python implementation of Lane Detection using OpenCV. The project aims to detect and visualize lane lines in images or videos, commonly used in autonomous driving and computer vision applications.

## Features

- Preprocessing of images using grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection.
- Region of interest selection to focus on the relevant portion of the image.
- Detection of lane lines using the Hough Transform algorithm.
- Visualization of detected lane lines on the input images or videos.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhaavya22/lane-detection.git
